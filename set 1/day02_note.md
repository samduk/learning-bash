### Using Arrays
- Set using index values:

  - `arr[0]=Hello; arr[1]=World`

- Refer to using index values and curly braces:

 - `echo ${arr[0]} ${arr[1]}`

 - `${arr[*]}` refers to all values in the array
 - `${!arr[*]}` shows all index values currently in use
 - `${#arr[*]}` shows how many items there are in the array

- Refer array_ex
