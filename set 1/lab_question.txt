- Write a script with the name servicemon. This script should monitor the availability of a service, of which the name has to be specified as a boot argument for the script. The script would run indefinitely, and if the service that it monirots stops, it should do three things:
  - Restart the service
  - Write a message to syslog
  - Send an email message to the root user


  Note: you can run the bash in debugging mode.
  Eg:
    bash -x servicemon http
